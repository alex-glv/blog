This website is called ItchyKnowsDevs.
It's a play on words of Itchy Nose Developers. Which doesn't make much sense either.

My name is Aleksandr Guljajev.

I reside in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
I am a freelance software developer.

I love progress. 
I love learning, 
I love customizing and crafting the tools I use.
I love technology and innovation.
I love tinkering, hacking, exploring and learning.
I hate most technologies, programming languages and operating systems.
I hate flame wars on what's better. It's what works for you or what doesn't.
I hate premature optimisation.
I hate arguments for the sake of drama.
I prefer learning concepts over implementation. That's why I try to learn the underlying principles instead of memorizing CLI commands.

In this blog I write mostly about the things I love. But occasionally about the things I hate.

I love this quote by Mark Twain: "Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect."

That said, I love reflecting.

Write me on my email address "gulyayev.alex" at "gmail.com" to tell me about the things you hate and love.
